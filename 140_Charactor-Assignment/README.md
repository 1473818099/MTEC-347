## What I did
A sawtooth wave with pitch modulation, delay and reverb.

## How I did it
- `Saw` for the main sound.
- `SinOsc.kr(3)` to modulate pitch.
- `DelayC` for delay.
- `FreeVerb` for reverb.


## The problems I faced (ABDYD: debugging log)
- Server not booted
- Researched about control rate used inside of an function

## How I overcame them
- s.boot
- Researched

## What code I used from others / elsewhere
None/ SuperCollider guide

## Where to find that code (specific links)
- SuperCollider docs: <https://doc.sccode.org/>
